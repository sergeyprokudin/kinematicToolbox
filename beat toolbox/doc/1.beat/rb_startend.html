 RB_STARTEND  Pick start and end points of event using a rubber-band box.
   When the user clicks on plot, use this as starting point, and start
   drawing a rubber-band box.  When the user releases the mouse button,
   use this as the last point.  The x-coords of start and end point are
   returned.

   x-coord of the first point, while ENDPT has the second.
