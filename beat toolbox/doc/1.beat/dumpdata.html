 DUMPDATA   Save data to file or database.
   DUMPATA saves a set of data specified by the user in a structured
   fashion.
   DUMPDATA (data) simply saves the numbers in DATA to a file in 
   whatever form they happen to be in (row vector, column vector,
   or matrix) with numbers separated by tabs.
   DUMPDATA (DATA, LABELS) saves the numbers in DATA (assumed a
   vector) associated with the labels given by LABELS in the format:
   LABEL::DATA
   with one label/data pair on each line.
   Note that LABELS is a regular character array
   Both these methods prompt the user for a file name.
   DUMPDATA (DATA, LABELS, DESTINATION) saves to DESTINATION.
   If the file DESTINATION exists, it will be overwritten.  Need to
   add code so that DESTINATION can also be a (local or remote) database.
