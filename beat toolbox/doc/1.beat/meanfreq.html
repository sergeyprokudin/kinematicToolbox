<pre>
 MEANFREQ  Compute mean frequency of a signal.
   FM = MEANFREQ (SPECTRUM, FREQ) computes the mean power frequency 
   of a signal with spectrum given by SPECTRUM, computed at
   the frequencies given by FREQ, returning the mean power 
   frequency in FM.
   FM is a weighted sum of the spectrum (sum of SPECTRUM * FREQ)
   divided by a sum of SPECTRUM.
