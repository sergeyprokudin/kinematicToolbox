 LOADMRF   Load MacReflex data file from disk
   [XDATA, YDATA, ZDATA, FS, MARKERS, FRAMES, FULLNAME] = LOADMRF 
   returns the data from the file in three matrices, one each for 
   x-, y-, and z-dimensions.  

   FS is the sampling frequency at which the data were collected.

   Each matrix has MARKERS columns and FRAMES rows (i.e., one row for
   each data frame).  The full path- and filename are returned in FULLNAME.

   LOADMRF (DATA_ARCH) performs the same function, but allows the user
   to specify the architecture of the machine on which the data were 
   collected (i.e., big- or little-endian).  If not specified, defaults
   to big-endian (Mac).

   LOADMRF (DATA_ARCH, FILENAME) loads data from the file FILENAME (note: it is
   assumed that the path is contained in the filename).
