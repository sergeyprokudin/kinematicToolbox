 COMPANG   Compute the (2-D or 3-D) angle created by a joint.
   A function that takes 3-D data and computes the angle defined
   by either three markers (points), or two lines/planes.  In the case
   of three markers, it computes the angle between two lines
   which are constructed by joining the points given by
   the three markers.  To compute a 2-D angle, the plane 
   in which to compute the angle is given by the final argument.
   THETA = COMPANG (MARKER1, MARKER2, MARKER3) computes the
   3-D angle between a line drawn from each point in MARKER1 and
   MARKER2 and a line from MARKER2 to MARKER3.  The angle
   is returned in the vector THETA.
   THETA = COMPANG (MARKER1, MARKER2, MARKER3, VIEW) computes the
   2-D angle between a line drawn from each point in MARKER1 and
   MARKER2 and a line from MARKER2 to MARKER3 from the perspective
   given by VIEW.  
   THETA = COMPANG (LINE1, LINE2, VIEW) works analogously.
   VIEW can be either 'xy' (x-y plane, top view in VScope parlance), 
   'yz' (y-z plane, side view for VScope parlance), or 'xz' (x-z plane, 
   front view for VScope).
