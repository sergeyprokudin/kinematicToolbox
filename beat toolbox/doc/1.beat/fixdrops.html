<pre>
 FIXDROPS   Fix dropouts in data.
   FIXED = FIXDROPS (DATA, DROPOUTS, METHOD) fixes dropouts in DATA
   indicated by DROPOUTS by eliminating said points (<A HREF = "../1.beat/getdrops.html">GETDROPS</A> would be
   a good way to determine these points).
   The points are then interpolated using the method specified by METHOD.
   METHOD is a string which can be:
   - 'spline': use cubic spline interpolation
   - 'linear': linear interpolation between last and next good points
   If METHOD is omitted, it defaults to 'spline'.
   If DATA is a matrix, each column is treated as a series of data.
