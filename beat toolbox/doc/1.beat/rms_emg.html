 RMS_EMG   Rectify and RMS an EMG signal.
       OUT = RMS_EMG (DATA, NUMPOINTS) computes uses the data contained in DATA
       and computes its RMS by squaring each data point, averaging NUMPOINTS / 2 
       points before and after the point to get a new value for the point, and then 
       taking the square root.  If DATA is a matrix, each column is assumed to be
       a channel of EMG.
       NUMPOINTS + 1 are used if NUMPOINTS is even.  IF NUMPOINTS is not entered, it
       defaults to 51.
