 <A HREF = "../1.beat/loadnor.html">LOADNOR</A>   Load a Noraxon MyoSoft file of analog data in ASCII format
   [DATA, FS, CHANLABEL, CHANUNITS, NUMCHANS, NUMSAMPLES FULLNAME] = <A HREF = "../1.beat/loadnor.html">LOADNOR</A> 
   prompts the user for the name of a data acquisition file to load.  

   It returns the data in the matrix DATA (one column per channel).  
   FS is the rate at which data were sampled, CHANLABEL is a (text) 
   label for the channel, CHANUNITS is text for the units being 
   measured on that channel (e.g., 'Volts'), NUMCHANS is the total 
   number of channels. NUMSAMPLES is the number of samples in each channel.  

   FULLNAME is the path- and filname of the opened file.

   <A HREF = "../1.beat/loadacq.html">LOADACQ</A> (FILENAME) loads data from the file FILENAME (note: it is
   assumed that the path is contained in the filename).

   Support coming for MyoSoft's own format.
