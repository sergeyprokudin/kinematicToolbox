 MEDFREQ  Compute median frequency of a signal.
   FM = MEDFREQ (SPECTRUM, FREQ) computes the median frequency 
   of a signal with spectrum given by SPECTRUM, computed at
   the frequencies given by FREQ, returning the median 
   frequency in FM.
   It uses the CUMSUM function to compute the area under
   the spectrum curve.
