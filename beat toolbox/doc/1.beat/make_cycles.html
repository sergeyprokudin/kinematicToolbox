 MAKE_CYCLES   Divide cyclic data into its component cycles, and create average cycle.
   [CYCLES, NEWOFF] = MAKE_CYCLES (DATA, ON, OFF, NUMPOINTS) 
   makes cycles out of the data contained in the vector DATA, 
   with ON and OFF being vectors containing which points to use 
   for contact on and off.  Cycles are created based on the points
   indicating contact ON (e.g., heel strike).

   NUMPOINTS is an optional argument for the number of points in 
   a cycle; it defaults to 250.

   The first column in CYCLES is the average; the remainder are the the
   individual cycles.  NEWOFF gives the indices in each average cycle of
   where the points given by OFF occurred.
