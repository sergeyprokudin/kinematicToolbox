TOE_OFF  Pick toe off events from data.

   TOE_OFF finds the toe off events in a set of gait data.

   TOE_OFF (DATA, DATATYPE, NUMSTDS, SIDE) finds the toe off events in the
   data given by DATA, which is of type DATATYPE.  DATATYPE is a
   string which is either 'motion', 'force', or 'switch'.  When DATATYPE is
   'motion', DATA is assumed to be a vector containing the
   forward-backward motion of the toe.  When DATATYPE is 'switch',
   DATA is assumed to be a vector of footswitch data for the heel (similarly,
   for 'force', force plate data is used, which is processed the same way as
   'switch').  If DATATYPE is not given, it is assumed to be 'motion'.  NUMSTDS
   refers not to sexually transmitted diseases, but to the number of standard
   deviations used in determining whether a point is a toe off if the
   data is specified as either 'switch' or 'force'; it defaults to 5.  SIDE
   is specified as 'l' or 'r', and tells whether this is data for the right
   or left side for V-Scope data (or for any other data where the coordinate
   system flips from one side to the other.  It defaults to 'l' (which should
   be appropraite for data taken with other systems).

   For 'motion' data, toe off is assumed to occur when the 
   velocity of the toe changes from backward to forward (passes
   through 0, going up) (this is reversed if side is specified as 'r').
