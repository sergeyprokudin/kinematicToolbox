 LOADLABVIEW   Load a binary Labview file of analog data.
   [DATA, FS, CHANLABEL, CHANUNITS, NUMCHANS, NUMSAMPLES, FULLNAME] = 
       LOADLABVIEW
   prompts the user for the name of a data acquisition file to load.  It 
   returns the data in the matrix DATA (one column per channel).  

   FS is the rate at which data were sampled, CHANLABEL is a (text) label for
   each channel, CHANUNITS is text for the units being measured on that 
   channel (e.g., 'Volts'), NUMCHANS is the total number of channels, 
   NUMSAMPLES is the number of samples per channel. 
   FULLNAME is the path- and filename of the opened file.

   LOADLABVIEW (FILENAME) loads data from the file FILENAME (note: it is
   assumed that the path is contained in the filename).

   Need to add functionality to specify data acquisition architecture
   (i.e., PC or mac)?

   Note: does not currently read file headers.  Dummy channel names are used,
   units are assumed volts.  The user is prompted to enter a sampling frequency.
