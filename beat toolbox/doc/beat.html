<P>
The Biomechanics at al., Toolbox (BEAT) is a collection of functions for that attempt to ease the task of analyzing biomechanics data by providing some core functionality to avoid reinvention of the wheel.  It consists of the following functions:

<PRE>
 File Access Functions
   <A HREF = "1.beat/dumpdata.html">DUMPDATA</A>     - Save data and labels to disk or database (DB interface tk).
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadacq.html">LOADACQ</A>      - Load an Acqknowledge format file of analog data.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadlabview.html">LOADLABVIEW</A>  - Load a binary Labview file of analog data.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadmrf.html">LOADMRF</A>      - Load MacReflex data file from disk.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadmyohdr.html">LOADMYOHDR</A>   - Utility to load header of Noraxon MyoSoft data file; used by <A HREF = "1.beat/loadnor.html">LOADNOR</A>.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadnor.html">LOADNOR</A>      - Load a Noraxon Winmyo file of analog data ASCII format or MyoSoft format.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/loadvsa.html">LOADVSA</A>      - A function that loads a .VSA type data file obtained from the VScope system.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/savestats.html">SAVESTATS</A>    - Save data from user to a tab-delimited file, appending if file exists.

 Motion and EMG Analysis Functions
   <A HREF = "1.beat/getdrops.html">GETDROPS</A>     - Get dropouts in data.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/fillgaps.html">FILLGAPS</A>     - Fill in gaps and make sure points are consecutive.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/fixdrops.html">FIXDROPS</A>     - Fix dropouts in data obtained using <A HREF = "1.beat/getdrops.html">GETDROPS</A>.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/h_strike.html">H_STRIKE</A>     - Pick heel strike events from data.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/make_cycles.html">MAKE_CYCLES</A>  - Divide cyclic data into its component cycles, and create average cycle.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/meanfreq.html">MEANFREQ</A>     - Compute mean frequency of a signal.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/medfreq.html">MEDFREQ</A>      - Compute median frequency of a signal.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/rms_emg.html">RMS_EMG</A>      - Rectify and RMS an EMG signal.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/set_baseline.html">SET_BASELINE</A> - Set the baseline level of a signal
   <A HREF = "1.beat/toe_off.html">TOE_OFF</A>      - Pick toe off events from data.

 Statistics
   <A HREF = "1.beat/comc.html">COMC</A>         - Compute coefficient of multiple correlation of a data series.

 User Interface
   <A HREF = "1.beat/donebut.html">DONEBUT</A>      - Function to indicate the pressing of a 'Done' button.
                  Deprecated in recent versions of MATLAB which allow for easy
                  dialog creation.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/excl_rad.html">EXCL_RAD</A>     - Callback function to make radio buttons mutually exclusive
   <A HREF = "1.beat/rb_startend.html">RB_STARTEND</A>  - Pick start and end points of event using a rubber-band box.
                  Superceded by RBBOX.

 Plotting Tools
   <A HREF = "1.beat/makeaxis.html">MAKEAXIS</A>     - Take sampling interval and generate true x-axis for plots.

 Miscellaneous Matrix and Vector Calculations
   <A HREF = "1.beat/compang.html">COMPANG</A>      - Compute the (2-D or 3-D) angle created by three markers.
                  (works like: 180 - subspace(line1, line2))
   <A HREF = "1.beat/dotprod.html">DOTPROD</A>      - Vector dot product.	
                  (superceded by dot)
   <A HREF = "1.beat/fillgaps.html">FILLGAPS</A>     - Fill in gaps and make sure points are consecutive.
   <A HREF = "1.beat/vectmag.html">VECTMAG</A>      - A function that will compute the magnitude of a vector x.
                  (replace with norm)

<A NAME="install"><H2>Installation</H2></A>

<P>
To install the BEAT Toolbox, create a directory for it with some imaginative name like <EM>beat</EM>.  Then take the compressed distribution, and decompress it into that directory (be sure to preserve directory/path info when you decompress!)  Then add the directory to your MATLAB path.  Voila!

<P>
If you have questions or complaints about the BEAT Toolbox or (more importantly) files and/or bugfixes you wish to contribute to it, please contact <A HREF="mailto:ian@nismat.org">ian@nismat.org</A>.  If you have a help or support request, please keep in mind that you can vent all the spleen you want, but any requests will be dealt with as the authors are able to handle them.  In other words, this isn't something the authors are paid a lot of money to do, so please don't expect 24x7-type support.  We won't call you back, but you'll get an e-mail response as soon as possible.  Perhaps if more than four people decide they want to use this, we'll set up a mailing list...
