In this folder, you can find: 

- the .m function for the CoR estimation

- The input data for testing the function. The coordinate of the Cor in the proximal segment are [10 10 10].

	- TrP: noise free matrix containing the trajectories of the markers attached
   	to the body B and expressed in the CS of  body A.

	- TrPn: noisy matrix containing the trajectories of the markers attached.
   	to the body B and expressed in the CS of body A. A gaussian noise is added to the marker trajectories.
